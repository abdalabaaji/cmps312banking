        "desc": "Qatar, characterized by its heterogeneous environment of mobile devices with varying characteristics, exhibits a situation that inhibits easy and readily accessible sharing of information through these devices because of limited mobile services, content creation, and delivery when compared to other developing countries in Asia and Europe.  Consequently, local mobile communication does not always meet the needs of highly emerging businesses and industries. In an attempt to address this issue, the proposed project involves designing and developing a platform called “Content Management & Delivery Platform” (CMDP) in support of mobile service delivery that integrates with the mobile network of Qatar Telecom (Qtel). The design of the platform is intended to meet the current and future needs in content creation and delivery for Qatari businesses and governmental organizations.  The CMDP allows content aggregation, rendering and delivery through various types of value-added mobile services including Pull, Push, WAP Push, and Bulk SMS    The key achievement of this project involves building a platform in which content providers can inject their mobile content to be delivered to their identified clients list using Push SMS, Bulk SMS and WAP PUSH. Another achievement is the ability for the content provider to host SMS and MMS content on the platform marketed to the platform visitors. The platform supports the delivery of the hosted SMS items through Pull mobile services in two ways, the first is through the web and the second is by sending an item code through SMS. Another achievement is the implementation of a billing schema between the platform users for the services used and enabling the business support system (BSS) module to generate statistical reports on some service activities.  The novelty of the CMDP architecture designed in this project is that the CMDP is scalable. It serves several content providers, while it also can be integrated with several network providers. In addition, the design establishes a foundation upon which further capabilities could be added in support of rich multimedia and IP-based services. The CMDP eventually provides a versatile platform to the application service providers and enterprises for managing, hosting, and distributing their wireless media, images, sounds, and streaming videos to their existing mobile subscriber base. In this project, we will propose a design that reduces the gap between the required high processing capabilities and storage capacity for content rendering, and the limited processing capabilities, storage capacity and restricted power consumption characterizing the mobile devices.

The processing that can be done on cloud utilizes its distributed multi nodes in parallel way. In such a way processing time is dramatically reduced and as such large amounts of data can be stored.  The first stage involved the installation of Hadoop and Map Reduce including the necessary configurations. Then we start to run examples in Hadoop such as Word Count and Grep then compared the Map Reduce function performance for both of them. These steps prepare us to write a dedicated Map Reduce function for the project.   The objective of this project is the usage of cloud HPC to process images in terabyte amounts. The results from the cloud technique were compared to the results obtained using a single computer deployment, both in terms of the time consumed for processing images. Then, we start to execute the image processing jobs on satellite image files and finally compare and documented the results.  Our project deals with large amount of image data that a single computer can’t handle because of its small memory size. Therefore, we design a new approach to address the problem of processing large scale images in parallel.  The challenge is to reduce the time taken to process huge data files and hence provide useful benefits to the society needs such as climatic data as processing by the Qatar Meteorological Department as well as other ministries involved in handling huge amounts of image data.

This project suggests an innovative framework that contributes to the efficient integration of people with deaf and hearing disabilities with the society by using wireless communication and mobile technology. This project is completely operator independent unlike the existing solutions presently i.e. CapTel [2] in the United States or RNID Typetalk [3] in the United Kingdom. The project depends on an extremely powerful Automatic Speech Recognition and Processing Server (ASRPS) which can process speech and transform it into text. It is speaker independent, which means, it recognizes the voice regardless of the speaker and the characteristics of his/her voice. On the other side there will be a TTS (Text To Speech) engine which will take the text sent to the application server and transmit it as speech. The second aim of the project is to develop an iPhone/iPad application for Deaf. The application facilitates the reading of the received text by converting it into animations which are constructed from a database, and assist the writing process by developing a customized user interface for Deaf to communicate efficiently with others.

Qatar is no less than the west since it established many centers to provide help to disabled people with government support; however, there is still lack in some fields especially in technology field such as Arabic software applications. In general, software companies in the Arab world do not build application for disabled people since they do not see the great finance benefit from this field. If such as system come to exist, the cost will be insanely expensive.  The project will target people with hearing and speaking difficulties who want to contact the emergency center using mobile phones. It is obvious these people cannot establish a conversation with the emergency operator to get the help they want. Therefore, the application will act as a medium between the two parties. The project’s solution will be a mobile application which will emulate the emergency operator protocol questions to the user using menu-driven interface.

Such maps are often more detailed and well designed compared to maps from services such as Google or Bing Maps. They also provide valuable cues for pedestrian navigation of an unfamiliar place[1]. Nowadays such maps are moving from static maps printed on paper or displayed on public notice boards to dynamic digital representations of space displayed on various kinds of devices ranging from mobile devices to large interactive multi-touch displays. Map-guided navigation using mobile phones is becoming increasingly popular[2]. Interactive Maps based upon Geospatial information systems (GIS) are seen as key applications for mobile users [1] as the user experience can be personalized and location-aware. The main focus for this project is to design a build a location-aware application to support pedestrian navigation on mobile devices using intuitive interactive maps with rich spatial information and location-based content and services.  The scope of this project phase is to design and build an interactive and extendable Campus Map for self-guided tour of Qatar University (QU) and for pedestrian navigation of the campus using a mobile device. We want to ensure that mobile computing device users can access appropriate information from wherever they may be located according to the best possible connection .The system will allow the user to orient themselves spatially with awareness of nearby campus landmarks. This in turn gives users reassurance that they are indeed located where they think they are. The prototype will be developed for Qatar University campus but it will be designed and built in way that can be easily extended to accommodate other maps such as those found in parks and other campuses. The purpose of the system is to allow QU community and prospective students and visitors to use their mobile phone to get an informative and entertaining campus visit as well as an intuitive way to access university resources. The system will provide an electronic alternative to the printed campus map augmented with location-aware multimedia content delivered on GPS/WiFi-enabled mobile phones. This format allows for frequent updates of relevant information (such as upcoming events) to be communicated to the university community in an entertaining and timely manner.

In this project, we deploy a modern “device-free” detection technique to build an indoor object detection system which can be utilized in several applications such as safety, and security systems. A device-free detection system can detect a person who doesn’t carry any electronic device involved in detection process. Another major quality of this system is it can operate without the need to install specific infrastructure in the area of interest. The system will depend on a wireless network already installed and used for wireless communication.   This project focuses on utilizing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) extracted from headers of frames broadcasted by existing wireless infrastructure for object detection purposes. RSSI values, which represent the wireless signal strength, are highly affected by changes in surroundings, in which wireless signals are broadcasted. Based on this fact, we build an object detection system composed of more than one base computers existing in the range of a monitored indoor location. Base computers will collect and transmit RSSI values to a server representing an intelligent detection and localization engine for the system. At the server side, RSSI values go through several calculation procedures to provide decision on whether a change is caused by an actual presence of a person within the area of interest. Initially, we employ a window-based measurements of RSSI signal variability combined with gradient method to detect the presence of an object in real-time. Such mechanism can be enhanced by comparing real-time RSSI readings after processing it to pre-stored historical data to improve accuracy.

With the use of a video camera fitted on it, a recording of the interaction between the robot and the child can be taken for each session to better understand and observe the child’s behaviour. This robot will also be able to detect the position of the child and perform the desired actions. The robot is intended to initiate conversations with the child just like a human being. It is aimed at improving the child’s interaction and obtaining the child’s attention to start the therapy session. The main idea behind this project is that a robot has less features for a child to decipher than when they are dealing with a human being. This robot thereby, minimizes the time needed by therapists to gain the child’s trust and attention, so that they can effectively utilize their time in teaching them basic communication skills and prepare them for the real world.

The platform will consist of a rotating LED display that displays messages and graphical representations entered by the user using a computer. An electronic circuit consisting of a row of LEDs controlled by a controller will be designed and constructed. A rotating platform mounted on an electrical motor will be built too. The circuit will be mounted on the verge of the rotating platform such that all LEDs will be at an equal distance from the rotating axe in a first configuration, or on the radius of a circle centered at this axe in a second configuration. As the platform rotates, the circuit will control the time at which each LED turns on and off, creating the illusion of cylindrical pictures or circular one depending on the configuration. The illusion will result from the eye's persistence of vision which allows holding previous LED positions in view even though they have already moved. The display will have rows and columns similarly to a matrix display, so that pixels will be specified in Cartesian coordinates. An attempted innovative aspect of this project will be to use RGB (Red Green Blue) LEDs in order to produce a colored display. As an innovative application, we will build a decorative car hub cap with an integrated rotating LED display. The microcontroller will be programmed in high language, and a program running on a computer will be developed to allow the user to specify the messages or the representation to be displayed.   In this report, we will give a high level design of our platform, some information related to the selected microcontroller and its programming language, the construction of the electro-mechanical platform, the electronic circuit, and the interfacing with the display.

        "desc": "Signature verification is a very active research field, it can be used by banks and forensic experts in determining whether a signature is genuine or forgery.  Signature verification is done by comparing a questioned signature with a set of one or several reference signatures. The output is a probability value indicating how probable it is that the questioned signature is genuine (or a forgery).  In order to do this, several features are extracted from the questioned and the reference signatures. If the distance between the features of the questioned signature and those of the reference signature is small, then it is likely that the questioned signature is genuine. However, if this distance is large, then it is likely that we have a fake scenario.  In the field of signature verification, two modalities are considered: the offline modality, in which scanned images of the signatures are available for comparison, and the online modality, in which all the trajectory used in writing the signature is acquired thanks to a digital tablet.  Online verification generally achieves higher verification rates than offline verification because motion-based features can be accurately determined from the online data, including speed, acceleration, start-points, end-points…etc.  The aim of this senior project is in a first step, to extract these motion-based features which characterize the online signatures. In a second step, matching algorithms which decide whether the questioned signature belongs to the same person or to a different person will designed.  The developed system will be evaluated on databases taken from international competitions: ICDAR 2009 signature verification competitions and an Arabic dataset collected by the students.  The students will also enjoy testing their system on a large WACOM tablet provided with a suitable interface.  "

By this way, by finding the relation between named entities, we may recognize some meaning of a sentence, as for example:  “HSBC has sold its share in Qatar Petroleum to QNB” that we might annotate to: “[Organization] has sold a [security] to [Organization].      In this project, we propose to build and manage incrementally a database of named entities from the most common to the more specific to the financial domain for Arabic text, where for each entity, we associate a possible list of instances, called semantic list.

Surgical simulation is a revolution in the field of health and education due to the fact that it helps reducing surgical errors. Many surgical simulations have been developed over the years, but they are still lacking the needed realism when compared to the real life scenario of surgeries. Lacking realism is due to the fact that only one sense has been incorporated in surgical simulations, which is vision.  Incorporating more senses takes the surgical simulation to the next level. Haptic and olfaction sensations were chosen to incorporate into the system in addition to the vision sensation. A scent diffuser was created and developed to interact with the simulation to produce odors when errors took place. Phantom haptic device was used to provide the sense of touch to the user. The components were combined and iHOSS was produced as a multimodal simulation.  The results of testing iHOSS indicate that the concept of incorporating more senses to the simulation enhances the performance of the user. This is due to the proven fact that using more sensation increases the remembrance of the user, and thus the previous mistakes are avoided. iHOSS has an impact in reducing surgical errors. The concept of incorporating as much senses as possible can be applied to diverse systems to get better performance and results."

Our project aim is to provide an efficient solution to this problem, by building an system that implements an autonomous Vision Based Collision Avoidance System (VCAS) which can be mounted on an electric vehicle, to control its motion.  The main idea of the VCAS system is to equip the vehicle with a single or multiple digital cameras that can continuously capture images of the road in front of the vehicle. The camera will be interfaced to a processor capable of efficiently performing digital image processing, which will be programmed to process the captured images in real time, to detect the obstacles and estimate distance between the obstacles and the vehicle. Then a decision support system, which will be programmed using the processor, as well, to take the decision if the obstacle existence is safe or dangerous. In case of danger, the VCAS will alarm the driver and make some driving control actions on the vehicle itself, such as slowing down and/or braking the vehicle. The driving control actions will be applied on the vehicle by interfacing the processor along with vehicle control system, that can be in the form of a microcontroller interfaced to an H-bridge, which in turn is directly controlling the electric motors driving the vehicle.

There have been many applications and techniques of steganography to transmit or send hidden information.

For this project, hiding information within images technique is used.     Many digital steganography algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, they still require some optimizations and research is still open in this area. Since the most challenging part in steganography techniques lie within determining which pixel bit of the image should be changed to embed the sensible data in, thus in this study, we propose to develop an improvement for the tri-way pixel value differencing algorithm (TPVD) by using a digital key to generate a random pixel pairs combination to embed the secret data in. In fact, implementing a randomization factor decreases the chance of detecting the hidden data by steganalysis tools. Moreover, in our algorithm, the secret data should be encrypted before embedding  it into the image. This introduces an extra layer of security since the secret data should be encrypted before starting the embedding process.   "

The traditional approaches used to send this information to the driver in driving simulations are visual and auditory channels, which can cause what many human computer interaction studies refer to as cognitive, or sensory overload. This led to studying an alternative approach, which is the use of the haptic-based information.    Haptic-based information in vehicles has major safety implications on reducing visual and auditory overload in driving, as it was scientifically shown that through this channel, multiple pieces of information are received at different parts of the body at the same time. Given that seats are interfaces that touch the largest area of the driver’s body, it is a sensible choice to consider using in the driving simulation.    The aim of this project was to design and develop an optimal vibrotactile seat. The seat was designed by experimenting with different design parameters such as the intensity, position, and the rhythm of vibrations. Results showed that users were able to recognize different signals based on the distribution of vibrators in the seat. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the response time using the haptic seat for vehicle navigation in an immersive virtual driving simulator using a Head-Mounted Display. These navigations were provided as auditory and vibratory feedback. Results from these experiments indicated that users preferred the vibrations to the audio feedback. However, response times showed that they responded to the audio slightly faster than the vibratory feedback. This is most likely due to inaccuracies when conducting the tests that will be fixed for future testing."

In addition, in online voting systems, users cannot assure that their votes were counted in an honest manner and voters and the surveys’ administrators cannot verify the final results.   Accordingly, homomorphic encryption will be used to encrypt the voters' votes. The encryption will be done in the trustee side and the trustee will encrypt two sets of numbers; one contains encrypted zeros and the other contains encrypted ones where the voter will construct his vote using these two sets. Furthermore, the decryption of votes will not be done by the voting system; it will be through a trustee party. To avoid votes miscounting, a verification protocol was developed in which the voter will give the vote to the server and the vote is divided to two tallies; one stored in the survey system and the other in the trustee. All of this contributes in giving the trustee the ability to verify the result. The secure survey system allows the admin to generate surveys and the user to vote in the survey where the system shows the results of the surveys and is able to verify the integrity of the results.

According to the statistics, epilepsy is affecting more than 40 million people in the entire world. However, antiepileptic medicine helps in treating these patients, roughly a third of all patients do not respond to the medicine treatment. From that point, seizure detection and monitoring system is important for keeping eyes on patients. In this project, we are proposing to develop seizure detection and warning system using electroencephalogram (EEG) which is a tool used to image the brain while performing a cognitive task. The system detects the seizure and notifies the observer or the caregiver by sending a text message to his mobile phone in case of the non-active seizure. However, if an active epileptic seizure has been detected, the system triggers an alarm. This project is very important for people who suffer from epilepsy as they can be attacked anytime and anywhere. Some people with epilepsy find it helpful to consider safety aids or equipment that might help them with day-to-day life. For example an alarm that can alert family or friends when someone has a seizure. Although these seizure monitors cannot make any guarantees, yet they can go a long way towards detecting danger and maybe even saving a life.

From here arises the need to authenticate websites that contain Quran and Islamic content by extracting errors, identifying and reporting them.  The first step of Authentication is to programmatically query Google and obtain the maximum number of websites that contain relevant content, this can be done by optimizing the querying method. After the websites are collected, the plain text needs to be extracted from the HTML source code. After this, Quran passages are identified and compared to the original Quran passages stored in the database. Finally tests are performed on a large set of extracted URLs to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution.   After conducting multiple tests, we concluded that most of the mistakes found in the online Quranic verses are spelling and typing mistakes. There are also some cases where some of the words are exchanged with different words, and cases where words are added or removed from the Aya. We also noticed that the alterations propagate between websites, the same mistake can be found in multiple websites.

Email also is not an effective tool for instant messaging. On the other hand, the discussion board in Blackboard (BB) can only be activated by the professor only if he/she finds needed. The other available ways of communication are using the instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger, and others.

Sometimes, this might be difficult, especially when the students need to collect all phone numbers of all students in a section. In addition, many students might not feel comfortable sharing their private phone numbers with other students.   The existing applications do not support an effective instant messaging system among a group of selected students without disclosing their phone numbers. To address these specific problems (how to provide instant messaging for a selected group, and how to keep users’ phone numbers private), we aim to develop a smart phone based application for Qatar University students.

The teddy bear can serve as a simple companion for children but also as a therapy tool for autistic children to attract their attention stimulate their curiosity and solicit their active interaction.  The teddy bear will consist of a humanoid robot embedded in a teddy bear soft toy with some useful sensors to capture feedbacks and sense its environment. The bear need to be capable of some image and speech recognition for a better user experience.  The system will consist of the following seven modules  1- The robotic skeleton:  This module consists of a humanoid robotic structure with several servomotors to ensure human like gestures like moving the head, arms and legs. The motors will operate under the control of a programmable control module to coordination their operation.  2- The sensor module: This module will hold all needed sensors for the teddy bear to sense its environment and capture the user interaction. Possible sensors would be for touch, vision, sound and temperature. For vison, a camera will be used to capture the presence of people and their face impressions and other light related situations like day and night. For sound, a microphone will capture commands and other sound related situation like crying and screaming to execute specific tasks accordingly.  3- The controller module: This module will require a program to be written in either a high level language like C or basic, or in Assembly. The program needs then to be uploaded to the microcontroller local memory so that it operates the moving robotic skeleton. The microcontroller is responsible for controlling all the robot mechanisms. It is also responsible for reading the sensors and activating the robotic gestures.   4- The control module: This module consists of a program running on a PC or a tablet. The program module allows to interface the human operator with the robot. The user will use this module to manually control teddy bear to instruct it to perform specific tasks like talking or moving its head, legs and arms.   5- The intelligence module: One of the most challenging tasks in this project is to device an intelligence module for the robot so that it responds appropriately to the human interaction when it is running in autonomous mode. We believe that this task required lots of processing power not provided by conventional microcontrollers. For this we propose to implement this functionality in lightweight android tablet.  6- The Communication module will interface the control module with the controller module. The communication will be in serial mode and fast enough to assure a real time transfer of data.  "

Machines have open vulnerabilities that can be used to serve a hurtful purpose that could wind up in the loss of information and assets. That said, the vulnerabilities are often caught or noticed. That leaves our machines on edge, knowing that those vulnerabilities could be used anytime to tackle our systems and that is not in our favor. The threats posed are usually ignored by an end-user, but when something happens, they end up being confused. The problem that lies is the severity of those vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities could simply leak users’ passwords, all the way to dangerous vulnerabilities like Information Leakage. Hence, the more robust the system is, the better it is in the end. Greatly, there are tools that can be used to scan for these types of vulnerabilities; however, those tools are neither easy to use or find. When tools are found, they require research and practice. Some of the tools go even too technical on an end-user, ending up puzzling the user. A solution would require extensive research and practice. Since users like dealing with easy interfaces, this project focuses on creating a simple-to-use frontend to please users’ view on things along with a backend system that does all the scanning a user needs. The backend will incorporate different security tools that tackle top dangerous network and web vulnerabilities that are common in incorporations and organizations. The backend of this project suggests that it follows two approaches:  1.  Network Scanner: This scans clients on a given network, retrieve information of the systems on the network including operating system and firewall information. Moreover, it gives information about the number of users on the network along with their IPs and other crucial information for the tools to work. The scanner detects the range of IP addresses and resolves host names. Also, it pings computer to see if they are alive, detects hardware MAC-address, listens to TCP and UDP ports. Then, it finds vulnerabilities on the enlisted machines and exports the results as .txt file.   2. Web-application Scanner: a crawling mechanism on web-applications to retrieve all available links on a web-application and scan for any vulnerability they might have.  Both the Network and Web-application scanners can be chosen manually from the frontend by the end-user. The aim of this project is to simplify the use of so many complicated tools in one compact view. The user will be able to choose which vulnerability they want to scan for. They will also be allowed to manually choose which singular device to scan through specific ports. This will ease things on the user, seeing that they do not want to complicate themselves with all the security complications.   "

Therefore, the main objective of this project is to give paralyzed people an opportunity to improve their quality of life and to increase their independency.  Paralyzed people are dependent on wheelchairs, which are specially modified to meet independent needs, which can function as their missing real limbs. Our project will add a robotic arm to wheelchair for the patient’s assistance. This extended robotic arm will enable paralyzed patients to perform small parts of their tasks. The arm will consist of three main hardware parts, the first one is a long arm, which can move almost like a normal human arm, the second part is the gripper, which exists at the end of the arm, and will help in gripping unreachable objects and the third part would be the motors which will be located along the arm to act as a joints replacing the missing limb and can almost be used as normal human arm. In addition, this design includes a smart functionality that helps users to use elevators. Due to the limited movement of a paralyzed individual the movement of the limbs will be controlled via a voice recognition system that receives commands to ease the usability and control of the robotic limbs. This project will assist paralyzed people to grip and move objects from one place to another. Moreover, it should help the user to select and press elevator buttons.

The proposed solution can be employed in smart home environments to equip them with real-time health monitoring technologies. Furthermore, it aims to develop new pattern recognition, fusion and classification algorithms for automatic fall detection and ECG analysis. The proposed system is designed to be used by elderly, diabetics, muscular patients, and neurological patients who are likely to fall, in addition to patients with cardiovascular problems who have higher probabilities to get heart attacks causing falls. This solution has three main features: (1) Sensing data gathered from the accelerometer and ECG electrodes embedded in the Shimmer sensing device; (2) Real-time monitoring and alerting system on the Zynq SoC board; (3) Medical logging consists of time and position of the fall, as well as the ECG signal and features extracted. Data processing and analysis are performed through the machine learning algorithm K-nearest neighbor (KNN) for fall detection. This algorithm is implemented in the programmable logic (PL) part of the Zynq. Other algorithms responsible for the ECG analysis and processing can be implemented using the processing system (PS) on the ZYNQ SoC using a hardware software co-design approach.

Home electronics like televisions, multimedia player, multi-function dashboards, on-board computers, game consoles, etc. are now built in cars, therefore distraction continues to increase by the reason of technology growth. So there is a need to develop a safe system for which the user is alerted when he/she does not show any intention of performing a specific activity. Over the past few years, several studies have been made to help people focus on driving and to assess the reliability of activity recognition from sitting postures to increase safety. Once the sitting attitude of the driver is evaluated to be aggressive, then there is a need to send a warning that can inform the driver to respond promptly. Haptic-based information in vehicles has major safety implications on reducing visual and auditory overload in driving (Jeon et al. 2013). Therefore, haptic seat makes a better choice for warning the driver of critical conditions. In addition, the seat is the main interface that touches driver’s body, it has been the haptic interface that can develop the safety of drivers and ability in transferring the information between the driver and the vehicle.  In this research, we present the design of a driving seat with two features: (1)Driver activities recognition by using a passive method for measuring body-postures by using two force sensor arrays to inspect the pressure patterns on driver’s seat and backrest. (2) vibrotactile seat to send the warning signals to alert the driver in case an expected activity was not performed by him/her.

Car plate, make and model of the car are detected first.  Then the face of the driver is detected for the security of the place where the system exists. Car plate number recognition is used by comparing the car photo in the database with car that enter to the gate. Furthermore, the make and model recognition of car is done by comparing the database of make and model of the cars at the gate. Furthermore, face detection of driver’s face is detected and kept in the dataset. In order to do this, the system use several features to make car plate recognition such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), difference of Gaussians (DoG) and Euclidian distance algorithms in Matlab. Also, it uses OCR that use pattern matching (template matching) for car make and model.  In addition, it use built- in detector called vision. Cascade Object Detector to detect people faces using Viola-jones algorithm. Those methods have the highest recognition rate in the literature. The project also aims in a first step to extract the features. In a second step, matching algorithms to decide whether the image of the car plate and the make, belong to same image or to a different image. Finally, if there is a matching in the images, the smart electronic gate will open and let the car enter, but if there is no matching, there is a second option which is the security guard.  "

In this project, we will focus on classifying tweets that retrieved from Twitter into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and five Arabic dialect groups: Egyptian (EGY), North African or Maghrebi (NOR), Gulf or Arabian Peninsula (GLF), Levantine (LAV), and Iraqi classes. This project is composed of two different implementation sides which are the back-end and front-end. In the back-end side, we will concentrate on solving Arabic dialect identification problem by building machine learning classifier. We are planning to achieve high accuracy results in detecting the Arabic dialect by improving the training data, and exploring new classifier like Deep Neural Network (DNN). We will go through building multiple classification algorithms, and then we will treat them as our baseline classifiers. In the front-end side, we are going to demonstrate the solution of the classification problem by developing a real-time system that works in mobile application. The app will allow the user to view his timeline with each tweet labeled by the Arabic dialects. Also, it will allow the user to view the public streaming tweets and the tweets of the trends in addition to tracking the streaming tweets, and then getting the tweets results of all these functions labeled by their dialects.

To address the issue of locating a specific room in a big building, we have planned to design a user friendly android based room locating application.  It will facilitate students and visitors with guidance on how they can reach their destination room and save time. We will start first applying our application in the Female Engineering building only, and we will expand it in the future to other buildings if we have sufficient time. There are many techniques used for indoor positioning such as: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, VLC (Visual Light Communication). However, in this project, we will apply Wi-Fi signals to find the location of a particular room by using wireless access points (routers). This technique is known as Wi-Fi based positioning system (WPS). This will give the user a marker inside buildings for his current and target room location. We will have a full database for paths and rooms of the building to facilitate reaching the required class room or office. Our application will also provide an emergency mode, in case of a situation for  immediate evacuation from a building.  If the user selects an emergency mode, our app will find the nearest exit door relative to the user position. An additional feature of our app is to guide the user to the right exit door of a building if he/she wants to go to a specific building.  For example, if the user wants to go to the food court or the Science building from the Female Engineering building, the app will show the user which door to be used in the building based on the current real time location of  the user. Even if the user is outside the university,  the app will guide the user how to reach to a specific room in the Female Engineering building. Our goal is to produce a beneficial and interesting android application that can serve the university students and visitors to find their target room using WPS since GPS doesn’t work inside the building.

Autism affects children in different ways which makes each child with ASD behave uniquely; however, some behaviors are common in many of the children. Our project aims to help in the therapeutic process of children with ASD in better learning the common behaviors using a humanoid robot and a customizable game module. Children with ASD find it hard to communicate their thoughts and feelings to other people yet they will be less hesitant to interact with a robot since it looks like a toy. Because of this, Nao robot will be programmed to perform activities that will enhance the social skills and the ability to concentrate in such children. Nao will also be programmed to explain and play games that we will create specifically for those children using different hardware components that will constitute the game module which will be designed as a toy train. These games will use sound and images to attract the children’s attention and to help them link images to words, feelings to images of face expressions and sounds to images, etc... It is strongly expected based on the feedback from psychologists, that the contribution of Nao robot and the games will trigger the visual oriented minds of the children which will help them learn and focus more. We will test our system on the children with ASD to ensure our main goal is achieved. Variables like type of response, time to respond to activity, memory and number of trials will be measured and analyzed for future improvements on our system. Children with ASD need care, love and support; this project will show the children that society cares about them which will hopefully motivate them to interact as desired.         "

Over 11% of them were reported as they have the most prevalent types of disabilities which are movement, flexibility limitations, and pain. According to statistics of US and Canada, disability rates is increasing with the increase of age. In 2013, less than 1% of the population are children under 5-year-old who are suffering from movement disabilities, the rate for people between 5-17 was 5.4%, then 10.5% for those who are between 18-64-year-old, and 36.6% where above 56-year-old. The above statistics shows that people are in need of some technology that will support and help them to live and interact normally with their surroundings.   For the statistics of Canadian Survey of Disabilities (CSD), they developed a severity score that relies on different factors, such as the intensity of the difficulties, number of the disability types, and the activity limitations frequency. The scores are four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. According to their statistics in 2012, 48.5% of the people who are suffering from disabilities are having severe and very sever score.

Some of these devices enables locomotion for its users by tracking user’s position in the real world and synchronize it into the virtual environment (VE). Hence, the user can walk freely in the real world while simulating the VE on the HMD’s screens. However, these devices are subject to a very crucial trade-off in terms of tracking area size and cost. This trade-off can dramatically affect the user experience provided by VR technology. Therefore, the solution of redirected walking was introduced in order to allow larger VEs in a limited tracking area. The idea of redirected walking is simply applying various mechanisms of distortions, like rotating the VE at a certain rate, that will let the user follow a certain path in real world which is different from what he sees through HMD screens. For instance, the user moves in a circular path in the real world while he thinks that he is moving in a straight path in the VE. The main concern for redirected walking algorithm is to apply these distortions without the user noticing them in order to make it feels more natural. In this project, many redirected algorithms such as, Steer-to-Orbit, Steer-to-Center and Steer-to-Multiple will be tested to find the best algorithm that’s feels more natural along with its optimal tracking size needed. Moreover, this project has the following objectives: (1) Propose a new redirected walking algorithm with ability to control the different shapes of the paths using Hypotrochoid equations and test the effectiveness of the new paths among the available algorithms over different types of VEs. (2) Introduce new adaptive algorithm that switches between redirecting algorithms depending on the type of the VE in use. (3) Develop a guidance avatar that will guide the user to the intended direction in the VE. This guidance character will distract the user from noticing the distortions and will avoid the user from leaving the tracking area and remain in the correct path."

In this work, we present a solution that enables the user to avoid connecting to evil twins (malicious APs) by visibly connecting himself/herself with the honest AP. This project presents a solution using visible light communication (VLC) to authenticate an AP and prevent the evil twin attack. Our solution is completely transparent to the end-user, and it does not require any changes to the already existing security protocols. Indeed, our solution involves two parties, i.e., the (honest) AP provided with a Wi-Fi interface and able to control a VLC channel, and an end-user, provided with a software that enables data to be read from a VLC channel, e.g., by using a webcam or any other ad-hoc component (photo-diode). Our solution exploits a three-step protocol: (i) the AP transmits its own public key to the end-user via an authenticated channel (VLC), (ii) the end-user retrieves the public key from the VLC channel, it transmits back to the AP a randomly generated seed encrypted with the received public key, and finally (iii) the AP broadcasts the user’s seed via the VLC channel. Eventually, the end-user will authenticate the AP by checking if the seed that it has previously generated matches the seed broadcast through the VLC channel by the AP.  "

Student’s overall academic performance is affected by their attendance. Indeed, keeping track of both the student's attendance and performance in class are the responsibilities of the instructor [1]. The traditional methods of taking attendance represent calling names or asking students to sign on a sheet of paper. These conventional ways are very time consuming, and thus inefficient and ineffective. Consequently, this project involves the design and development of an attendance system that aids both instructors and students to track the attendance in an optimal way. ADIC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) represents a wide-ranging category of technologies that is used to gather information from an individual, object and image without any manual data entry [2]. As a result, an AIDC Attendance System would be more effective and efficient in taking the attendance. Nowadays, AIDC systems are used frequently as they make managing inventory, delivery, security and documents easier. The specific technology that is used in our system is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The system must works as follow, once the student enters the classroom having the passive tag which transmits a unique identification number, the RFID reader, which will be attached by the door, will read the tag serial number and mark the student present. Moreover, this process will not require any physical contact between the user and the reader. In addition, there is a software part, which consists of a web-based application accessible by both students and instructors, that stores and retrieves student’s attendance. Besides, sending notifications via email, that alerts students when exceeding a specific number of absences and allow them to keep track of their attendance, will also be a part of our system. Indeed, using RFID technology to get student attendance as developed and deployed in this study will eliminate the time wasted during manual gathering of attendance and will also give a great opportunity for the instructors to view statistics for allocation of appropriate attendance scores.

Roughly around 1.24 million of people are killed and 50 million are injured every year due to road traffic accidents according to global statistics [1]. Distracted driving can be defined as any type of event or cause that takes away driver’s visual (eyes off the road), manual (hands off the steering wheel) and cognitive (mind off the road) attention from the driving task. Around 30% of road fatalities are related to drowsy driving or driver fatigue according to [2]. Sleep debt, drugs, toxic substances or alcohol and monotonous driving at late afternoon or evening are the main causes of drowsiness. Someone may think why not to increase road safety by preventing accidents resulted from such reasons. The solution proposed in this project is to monitor driver’s drowsiness and provide precaution procedures on-road to avoid potential vehicle accidents using a nonintrusive detection system of driver's heart and eyes. Detecting drowsiness of the driver is not an easy task and having accurate results makes it quite challenging. This solution is a combination of both computer vision and heart rate variability. Image processing and ECG have been both applied before, but combining the two approaches into one system with a manageable complexity will provide accurate results for drowsiness detection without disturbing the driver. The computer vision approach handles image processing that will check the features of the driver's face, precisely the eyes with more than one method available. The ECG approach handles heart rate analysis to identify the danger points that could be considered as drowsy states. By integrating the two approaches,  the system captures true drowsiness conditions of the driver. The system will alarm the driver without having any false warnings related to inaccurate results by one of the two approaches."

The causes of car accidents vary from one place to another but the most commonly occurring reasons are using the phone while driving, followed by the fact that a percentage of people drive in a reckless way shifting lanes without noticing while cruising in high speed. Some drivers also do not take extra cautions during bad weather such as rain and clogged roads. We plan to develop an application software that tackles these problems. The application will have features that could help users to ensure their safety and other drivers on the road.  One of the problems of dangerous driving is the intensive use of mobile phone while driving, and this is commonly seen here in Qatar. Our application will notify the user if he/she reaches the speed limit of the road in the current location. In such situation, the application will limit some functionalities of the phone until either the user gets back to a safe speed or stops using the phone. What makes our application special is that it prepares statistics and collects data about the driving behavior of the user over a period of time, Such statistics include how many times the driver was near the speed limits while using the phone; how long he drove safely, etc. The statistics could be a weekly summary of the user’s driving pattern. Moreover, our application can detect fast changing of lanes very frequently within a short amount of time. Our application will notify the driver in such situation of drifting away from the lane. Many accidents occur due to frequent changing of lanes with high speed while using phone.   Our application will constantly monitor the driving pattern and use of mobile of the user throughout the driving, and will keep alerting the user. The alert will keep the user fully aware of the road condition, speed limit of the current road, and focus during the driving. It is well known that bad weather like rainy weather and water clogging of road could lead to a huge increase of number of an accident because most drivers do not take that extra caution in such weather and road conditions.   In order to improve the awareness of the drivers, our proposed app is going to alert the driver about the bad weather, bad road condition, speed driving, and the habit of frequent lane changes with high speed. The ultimate objective of our application is to raise driving awareness and safe driving by alerting the driver about reckless driving, mobile usage during driving and the weather condition.  "

Based on the observation of students’ difficulties, we drew more focus on some programming concepts over others. Furthermore, QU students struggle with the syntax of JAVA. The course of OOP is introduced after the course of Programming concepts. The students are expected to be able to code in JAVA reasonably since they know the basics of programming. The problem is that they have learnt programing with C++ not JAVA. Thus, even if they get the concepts well, they would struggle with the syntax and errors, consequently they get stressed and do not know how to proceed.  The game introduces the logic first, then the code. The students will be able to deal with the problems and how to fix them if they know what they are doing. The game simulates the logic as if it is a real life situation. The students will link coding with real life, hence when they are introduced to JAVA code, they will focus on the syntax after they understand well the logic.  JAVA is the language we chose to teach, since it is the most important one during the years spent on CS major. Most students are not aware of its importance while taking it. By linking JAVA to the real world in the game, students will be motivated to keep learning during the course. This game is mostly efficient if it is played before getting involved with OOP course.  The aim of this game is to ensure that students comprehend the logic before they start coding. Therefor unlike several other coding games, each challenge of the game does not begin with coding straightforwardly.

Examples of current law enforcement methods include stationary cameras used to detect overspeeding, and passing red traffic lights. Despite these efforts, there are several reckless behaviors that remain undetected, such as sharp sudden turns, and speeding over speedbumps. This project aims to detect a number of such behaviors which typically consist of different patterns of speed and angles of car deviations.  Our proposal is composed two modules, Data Collecting Module and a Data Analysis Module. The Data Collecting Module employs the use of a chip (Raspberry PI) that is placed inside the car and connected to a few motion-tracking sensors. These sensors collect the necessary data related to kinematics of the moving car including speed, acceleration, and path deviation. The data collected from the sensors is directly segmented and saved on the memory of the chip. Using a chip, the collected data is then sent to a connected DAM composed of a more powerful computer (Data Analysis Module). This system is initially trained to analyze and classify the collected patterns into reckless and safe events using machine learning algorithms. The analysis also involves identification of the event type as sharp turns, multiple and frequent change of lanes, harsh speed bumps, sudden acceleration or deceleration. The chosen algorithms are selected based on its classification accuracy along with satisfying the requirements and constraints of the project. Different reckless behaviors are also given a score based on a proposed recklessness metric. Another aspect of this project is a website/mobile application that will allow end-users to monitor and track their driving behavior.

        "desc": "In this project, we focus on developing a secure fingerprint identification system. When compared to the traditional “Username/Password” model for authenticating users, fingerprints provide a useful balance between security and convenience. Instead of remembering a strong password, a user can simply swipe her finger to prove her identity.  Fingerprint identification technology is found in many applications including mobile devices, banking, time keeping, point-of-sale, access to facilities, etc.    The project will design a fingerprint scanner module (sensor and microcontroller) connected to a host machine, which could also be connected to a cloud server holding the database of registered fingerprints. The project employs a new method for hardening fingerprint authentication systems by minimizing their attack surface. The proposed authentication system remains secure even in the presence of successful OS, VM or BIOS attacks. This is achieved by processing fingerprint functions (e.g., feature extraction, matching, and storage) inside the Intel's new enclave technology; Software Guard Extensions (SGX). The SGX technology enables the creation of a hardware-protected area of execution in memory called an enclave. The data and code running inside an enclave are protected against modification or disclosure. This provide confidentiality and integrity of these functions. Moreover, sensitive fingerprint data will be protected protected against unauthorized access.    "

Blood can not be manufactured, as it can only come from the generous blood donor volunteers. In undeveloped countries, reaching for blood supply is challenging; Because finding the person with same blood group, and blood factor with a short deadline could be difficult or costly.     In order to solve the problem, we develop a mobile application that connects blood donors with recipients. The application is inspired by popular apps such as UBER and LYFT, that connect drivers with riders. UBER and LYFT give the ability to request rides using a smartphone. From that sense, we develop an application that is capable of solving the featured problem. The goal of our work is to set up a simple, secure environment to connect donors with recipients. The impact of this is to minimize the percentage of blood shortage around the world, as pursuing a blood donor should become an easy task. This will also enhance the efficiency of hospital by improving processing, testing and storing blood rather than running campaigns.     Our app works as follows. First, users register in the system as recipients or donors. Next, when a recipient needs blood, a  user can search for possible candidates using the app, which provides him with the best donor candidates who are available at the chosen time within a reasonable proximity to the chosen hospital. The app presents a list of possible donors ranked by their location and previous ratings, which are based on their previous performances. The recipient can now book an appointment, and proceed to the hospital at the agreed time. Finally, to ensure proper participation and accurate user ratings, after the blood donation takes place, the application allows users to use a barcode scanner technology combined with a rating system for each party to rate the other.  This ensures that misbehaving users get lower ratings, and are eventually ignored by the app.  The application will be a life changer to thousands of people who need blood or want to donate in the nearest future. Because it targets and supports all different ages and groups in the society and both direct and volunteer donations."

Therefore, we are proposing an IoT based wireless fire alarm that will be easy to install. The proposed system is an ad hoc network that consists of several nodes distributed over the house. Each of these nodes consists of a microcontroller (ESP8266 nodeMCU) connected to smoke and temperature sensors that continuously sense the surrounding environment to detect the presence of fire. Once fire is detected by a node, it will send a signal to a centralized node that will be triggered to send a GSM message to the fire department, call the user and alert the house by producing an alarm. The centralized node consists of a Raspberry Pi microcontroller integrated with a GSM module and other sensors for fire detection. The implemented idea can be applied on several other alarm systems, such as water leakage, gas leakage, intrusion detection, etc. The main advantage of the proposed system is its reliability, since it will use ad hoc network that mainly depends on WiFi connection between the sensing, without using a fixed WiFi access point. Also, it uses the available GSM cellular network to send SMS alarm messages and, if needed, can make voice calls with pre-registered voice messages. "

Despite their wide range of applications, commercial availability, and variety of uses, drones can easily be purchased and used by unauthorized malicious individuals, posing many illegal and dangerous situations. For example, diverging drones around sensitive and government locations such as airports and military bases can cause damage to airplanes, and interference with communication systems. One of the major anticipated dangers of drones’ illegal utilization is terrorism, where a terrorist can attach explosives to a drone and fly it to sensitive or crowded places. These malicious acts pose a serious threat to people’s safety and national security. An anti-drone system is needed to prevent the damage induced by malevolent drone usage. Anti-drone systems provide means to detect drones’ existence, classify their legitimacy and threat, and impede them from preventing access to critical and crowded areas. In this project, we design an anti-drone system comprising the following stages: detection, localization and tracking. The functionality of the detection method is to merely indicate the existence of a drone within a predefined range using multiple deployed video or wireless-based detectors covering the area. Video surveillance is one of the methods for detection, where the existence of the drone is determined based on a visible light video camera feed, and video processing techniques based on movement detection and frame differencing will be performed on the received video feed. In case more than one detection method (or more than one detection device) are used, a fusion center collects the data resulting from each of the devices responsible for detection, and fuses them under a certain predefined rule to take a final collective decision on the detection of existence of such drones by utilizing machine learning approaches. The localization stage detects which localized detector has located the drone and its position based on the features extracted by the machine learning algorithm, in order to pinpoint the exact area where the drone is located. Finally, the tracking algorithm logically links the moving positions of the drone and captures them at every instance until successful neutralization of the drone disables its access. As such, the project combines innovative computer engineering methods and machine learning knowledge to address the problem of malicious drone activity that may directly threaten national security.

The CEPROQHA Project has for a goal to design a complete cultural heritage management and preservation platform. This platform is the main middleware that connects all the stakeholders (museums, heritage institution, targeted audience, and tourism institutions).  Content management systems or collection management systems (in the cultural heritage context) are software tools used to create, manage, curate, share, exhibit and preserve cultural heritage assets. These systems are frequently adapted to several use cases which makes them one of the pillars of the CEPROQHA project.  A collection management system is more likely to be a web-based solution similar to a traditional content management system. Content management systems are web-based frameworks that gives the ability to multiple users with different permissions/access levels to create, edit, enrich and share information (“content”) to wider audience.  CMSs are considered as distributed platforms that allow simulations access of multiple users at the same time. As an example of a CMS platform the web framework WordPress, Joomla, MediaWiki, etc. Basically, A web framework is called a CMS if at allows this set of functionalities: Create, Edit, Publish, and archive content.

However, it is very important to have the location identified inside the buildings especially in bigger buildings as it can be confusing to locate a specific room. Therefore, bluetooth is the solution to the accuracy problem of the GPS, as it is possible to use bluetooth to identify and locate the location more accurately within in a much smaller radius. In fact, the idea is to install several bluetooth sensors inside the targeted building and have an application software in a smartphone that can track where everything inside the building is, and show the exact direction to it. Actually, using our application will make it easier to find locations inside a building for a lot of individuals, the use cases for application can be anyone from visitors to student to professors if we consider using the application for Qatar University’s campus. Also, this idea can be used in many other places such as ministries, shopping malls or even hospitals.  Technically, previously installed bluetooth sensors can send signals and the mobile will track the signal, the idea is that when the bluetooth signal is stronger from a specific sensor means that the person is closer to this particular sensor, and if the signal is weak it means otherwise."

Children with autism experience difficulties in both verbal and non-verbal communication. They have trouble in comprehending what other people say or feel. Consequently, it is hard for them to express themselves through gestures, facial expressions, touch or even words.      Based on their position on the spectrum, many autistic children can show aggressive behavior in certain situations, either towards themselves or the people around them. An excellent technique to help children with autism learn how to manage their aggressive behaviors is by using a social robot with special skills to facilitate the children’s learning process. Therefore, our target is to create a low-cost social robot that can socialize with autistic children and calm them down in a well studied manner.     The robot will be programmed to train the autistic child to answer general questions, like how to respond to greetings, and what their name or age is, etc. Another main function of the robot is to be able to help the child to get over his panic state. This can be done by first classifying the panic states at which the child is at. Leah Kuypers has assorted panic states and aggressive behavior into four zones of Emotional Regulation: Blue, Green, Yellow and Red.    The blue zone is when a child is at a state of sadness and boredom. They are not aggressive, but they are not calm either. Instead they are slow and show signs of depression. The green zone, is the ideal zone at which the child should be. They show happiness and sharpness, making them ready to learn. The yellow zone is when the child is starting to get frustrated and worried, or overly excited. They tend to act silly and lose some control. If they are further triggered, they would reach the red zone, which represents extreme aggressive behavior. Children in the red zone are angry, harmful and out of control. IN this design, the robot will be programmed for various activities suitable for these zones as needed. The activities can be switched from one zone to another by the teacher as needed."

For example, drones that are used for civilian purposes can range from surveillance, data collection and analysis, traffic monitoring, to more of a business and personal use such as videography and delivery services. However, the noticeable use of drones can also cause major security threats if they are used for malicious and harmful activities such as interfering with aviation, flying around prohibited territories to steal private data, or even worse where a bomb-carrying drone can threat someone’s life. Such activities raise the importance of having an anti-drone system to mitigate and prevent any damage caused by such drones. To counter un-authorized drones, there exist many solutions utilizing various approaches and technologies; however, they focus only on one or few stages of the process: detection, localization, tracking, and jamming. This project will propose a comprehensive design of a real-time anti-drone system that is capable of tracking the drone and automatically jamming it. Commercial drones use Radio Frequency (RF) signals to communicate with and receive commands from its remote controller; hence, a jamming signal can effectively be used to disable the communication resulting in the drone performing either an emergency landing or returning to its base. Our system will utilize a 360-degree camera for an omni-directional coverage and real-time tracking. Once a drone is tracked, the jamming device, mounted on a controllable and movable arm, will be directed at the drone to disrupt its malicious activity. "

Thus, governments are taking special care to improve the healthcare provided in their countries. One important aspect of healthcare is the continuous healthcare monitoring of individuals either in hospitals or at home. Healthcare monitoring speeds up the intervention of the caregivers at the right moment to save lives. IoT technology can play an important role in the process of continuous healthcare monitoring as the process of alarming caregivers when needed. In the proposed system, the individuals are equipped with wearable IoT nodes that are capable of capturing vital signs, processing them in real-time, then communicating with the alarming system to notify caregivers in case of abnormal situations. There is a plethora of vital signs that can be captured by the system. Some signs may need simple processing, such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), body temperature (BT), the estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood (SpO2), etc. Signs that need more sophisticated processing can be equally captured, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyography (EMG), etc. The captured signs can be utilized in different ways. They can be stored on an IoT cloud for further processing to monitor the daily readings of the signs and how they change during a certain span of time as well as detecting anomalies in complex signs such as ECG and EMG. Moreover, the signs can be processed at the level of the IoT node to assess the case if the captured sign is out of range of normal values, which can, in turn, start an alarming process in case of abnormality.  The alarming process can be in the form of an automatic voice call, SMS message, email message, social network notification, etc.   Furthermore, healthcare monitoring can be extended to fall detection of unattended individuals, such as elder people and children. Techniques of fall detection can use motion and orientation sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc., or the detection can be image-based by detecting the different postures of the individual using real-time image processing techniques.  Moreover, the healthcare monitoring system can be extended to manage bed-sores for bed ridden patients, by sensing how much time was the patient in a certain position, and accordingly the system can decide to inflate or deflate an air mattress below the patient to reduce the possibility of bed-sores creation. This subsystem needs the integration of pressure sensors to detect the position of the patient and actuator that controls the operation of an air pump to inflate and deflate the mattress.

To the best of our knowledge, there is good system that could efficiently be used in such a critical situation to alert the medical personnel. The objective of this senior design project is to build such a device (Diabetes Alert System) and make it available to those affected patients in Qatar. In making this system, we will need to make sure that it should be cheap, easy to use and save lives in many cases. We plan to build it from off-the-shelf hardware and software. The purpose is when a significant increase or decrease in the blood sugar is detected, an alert is sent to family members and/or nearby friends to provide immediate help to the patient. If none of family members and friends is available, the nearest emergency medical personnel will get the alert and will be able to help the patient in due time."

        "desc": "The system helps students by guiding them with their course registration and academic progress. Each student has their own RoadMap, which is updated every semester depending on their performance (GPA). Students will be guided on which courses they should register every semester and how much progress they have made through their academic years. This helps reduce the pressure on the academic advisors, since many students are not aware of the whole course registration process. The academic advising office is overcrowded during the add/drop week, many students do not get the chance to meet the advisors which might lead to graduation delay because of the unawareness."

While this works excellently for outdoor navigation, it can’t pinpoint someone’s location inside a multistory building. In order to obtain accurate data of the user’s location indoors, we need to implement alternative methods that can pinpoint where the user is inside the specific building as well as at what floor they are located. Luckily, many methods have already been used to provide such a service, and these methods are known as indoor positioning systems. The methods use specific algorithms (such as triangulating the device’s position) to give the user their near-exact position. The implementations of indoor positioning vary from Bluetooth beacons and Wi-fi to radio signals and Assisted GPS."

The Blood Donor Unit at Hamad Medical Corporation does not have an online donation system. This system communicates with the center and people to ease the process of blood donation with additional benefits.The idea of donating blood through a website may not be very common, however, it is doable and possible. Blood donation is critical especially in an emergency situation. In case of emergency, instead of using the traditional process of donating blood by heading to a hospital which requires registration and documentations. This proposed system will take care of this process by providing more efficient and speed as it is done through the website. Several benefits accompany this system such as it is easier to search for donors, specific blood types, tracking amount of blood donated, recording real-time inventory of blood bank and many other information regarding the donor. Donors have the option to express their interests in donating blood voluntarily through this web site. The hospitals can also easily communicate with potential donors to organize the blood extraction process. The system will ultimately provide a systematic blood donation process and a better management of doners. This proposed system is expected to raise the people's awareness in the society to donate blood for people who need it because it costs nothing and make the donor feel great afterwards.  "

By building the driverless car that will be guided by a blue road similar to the one done at Souq Waqif with a GPS tracker that will help establish its location and time it will take for its arrival. Many sensors will be required into building the bus such as ultrasonic sensor which allows to detect if any obstacles are on the way in our case if any student wants to cross the street. Another sensor we will be using is the RGB sensor which will help detect the blue road and stay in lane in order to reach its destination. Lidar sensor will also be needed which is important to collect data of any objects being on the way using laser technology.
